# I2ROS Autonomous Drone
This is the repo for group project autonomous drone of team 3 in course introduction to ROS in summer semester 2022.

## Introduction
This project aims to perform cooperative UAV exploration in unity simulation environment with two drones. The range of the mapping area is 100m x 100m, the target resolution of the map is 1m.

Watch the video below to get an intuition of how this project works.

## Quick Start
1. install dependencies
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-octomap* ros-noetic-navigation ros-noetic-gmapping
   ```
2. build the workspace
   ```bash
   cd drone_ws
   catkin build
   ```
   Note: if you encounter error during building, source the workspace and try again.
3. launch all in one
   ```bash
   roslaunch state_machine_pkg all_in_one.launch
   ```
   After launch, press space in the command line. The drones will take off and start exploring, then land automatically after the exploration is done.
   
   Note: You can launch each segment of our project separately, see segment description for detail.

## General structure
![plot](./images/structure.png)

The project basically contains 6 modules. 
- The **simulation** module read Sensor data from unity and send commands to it. 
- **Mapping** reads camera frame and depth image and publishes a global octomap and a projected 2d map. 
- **Planning** takes the map as input and listen to commands from exploration to perform path planning. 
- The **state machine** monitors drone state and user input and triggers control and exploration according to the current state. 
- **Control** read the drone state from simulation and send command back to make sure that the drone follows the path or commands from state machine. 
- **Exploration** takes the current generated map and drone state to decide where are next goals for drones to explore.

The following is a concrete node graph of the project.

## Remaining problems

- Sometimes the drone will still hit the wall because of not quick enough octomap generation
- The landing performance differs in different computer because we use a optional z-offset to control the landing smoothly. Due to performance variaty of different devices the optimal z-offset on different computer can be different.

The following is the introduction of each package in the project


# Simulation

This module communicate with unity environment. It reads sensor data from quadrotor and generate tf according to it. It also subscribes to command topics and send the commands to unity.
## Simulation package

### Run Unity and ROS on one machine:
```bash
roslaunch simulation simulation.launch
roslaunch controller_pkg circle_demo.launch 
```

### Run Unity on host machine and ROS on virtual machine:
1. Establish TCP port forwarding for port 9997 and 9998 between host and virtual machine.
2. Run unity on host machine.
3. Edit the ip address in `on_host_simulation.launch`.
4. Run the following commands on virtual machine:
    ```bash
    roslaunch simulation on_host_simulation.launch
    roslaunch controller_pkg circle_demo.launch 
    ```

### Nodes:
- Quadrotor / Quadrotor2:
  - unity_ros (read data from unity)
  - w_to_unity (send command to unity)
  - state_estimate_corruptor_node (add noise to sensor data)

The simulation package uses simulation time, which is counted from the unity startup.

Subscribe to topics under `Estimation` or `IMU` to get the current state. 

Subscribe to topics under `DepthCamera` / `RGBCameraLeft` / `RGBCameraRight` to get the camera info and image. 

Publish to `Commands/rotor_speed_cmds` to control the drones.

# Map Service

This module firstly projects the depth image onto the RGB camera frames. Then generate RGB point clouds using the projected depth image and the rgb image. The rgb point clouds from two drones are then used to generate an OctoMap, which is finally projected into a 2d map.

# Exploration

This module firstly generates a costmap with the projected map, then each drone applies greedy frontier search that is defined by explore_lite. During the goal assignment, the explore_lite package is modified to reject goal points that are aloready signed to other drones. Furthermore, some special limitations are set when searching for frontiers and goal points to improve efficiency. A service server and a service client are added in order to communicate with the state machine. Explore can be triggered by state machine. The state of state machines can also be switched to "landing" by the exploration module.
## explore package

Contains launch files to start exploration.
### Main Dependencies

- costmap_2d
- service_pkg

### Quick launch

After launching simulation, map, and planning:
```bash
roslaunch explore costmap_explore.launch
```

### Nodes

# Control

This module consists of controller_node and trajectory publisher. The PID parameters in controller and other dynamic coefficient are tuned such that drone can fly smoothly. The trajectory publisher subscribes to the state topic and calculate the desired velocity and poses in different flying stages based on trajectory planner. The controller node take these requests and compute a control command which is send to unity. An offset parameter is added to make the landing look more nature.
## controller package

- pure path following 
- rotate while following path
controller_node for torque controlling.
